# BadCharacterGenerator
This is a small project to understand the basics of Tkinter and Python UIs. The aim was to make a character portrait generator.

It is important that you have pillow installed for this script to run. 
  http://pillow.readthedocs.org/en/3.0.x/installation.html
  $ pip install Pillow 

Running the script launches the gui
  - random will make a random portrait
  - saving will pop up a save dialog to save your generated character portrait
  
You should be able to add any .png to the folders and they will work accordingly, I suggest you do this. Alpha channels are respected.

This project also serves as a case study for why you should get a decent artist.
