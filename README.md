![Are you sick of professional character portraits? Like those you find on Open Game Art? (There are two portraits here from Valyria Tear, they look pretty good. don't ask about Valyria Tear, i have no idea what video game that is. if you need to use alt text for pictures there is a good chance you are seeing impaired and don't enjoy video games all that much. also this character generator probably wont be of any help to you, so you can stop reading now.)](http://i.imgur.com/qbeh60f.png)

![Do you like slipshod UI? If you are blind and have this text dictated to you, you probably don't see a point in having a good UI. Honestly, you probably don't see much of anything at all. The link below defines the word 'splipshod' which is how I describe the UI, I bet you can guess the definition](http://imgur.com/TfUayV7.png)

![This asks if a random button attracts your attention, if you could see, you would notice a a button labeled random. you might even chuckle at the wordplay of a random button, however you most likely would't.](http://imgur.com/KLGNf4J.png)

At first I spelled immediately wrong, probably because I was working too fast.

![This next picture introduces the 'bad character generator with a screenshot. It's really quite underwhelming. On the bright side it definitely lives up to its reputation for generating bad characters. I mean, you can't see it to verify it for yourself, but trust me you aren't missing much.](http://imgur.com/m6jvAyS.png)

For all your bad character needs!

![This image shows a series of faces that you can make with the generator. Most of them look kinda dumb. The caption claims you can make over 6 differnt faces](http://imgur.com/HGcC0dq.png)

Maybe even like 12!

![This pic describes what the program is perfect for (annoying profile pics, creating a poor reputation, building resentment on the internet). Thats pretty much what this program is good for.](http://imgur.com/ED9oQgT.png)

rejected uses:
- bothering your cat
- a meal replacement
- cure for cancer

![This pic is actually useful (don't get your hopes up its the only one). you can add images where the other image files are and they will show up.](http://imgur.com/QuTh1rv.png)

The coolest thing about this is that you can add files to the 'Head' or 'Hair' folders and they should show up in the editor. Alpha channels are also respected in the files, so I'm sure there is cool stuff you can use. If you are actually an artist, you could probably make a decent character generator with a disappointing UI with this program.

![This image is titled "Saitama Tax" it features a poor imitation of Saitama from the Manga/Anime One Punch Man. In case you haven't already guessed, I don't have a girlfriend.](http://imgur.com/vPEMWp8.png)

ONE PUNCH!

This is advertising for the bad character generator posted here. Really just did this so a few people would look at my python script and tell me what I'm doing wrong. So far the closest someone got was to suggest I make changes to how I'm building my exe.
