# BadCharacterGenerator
0. This is a small project to understand the basics of Tkinter and Python UIs. The aim was to make a character portrait generator.

1. It is important that you have pillow installed for this script to run. 

  http://pillow.readthedocs.org/en/3.0.x/installation.html
  
  $ pip install Pillow 

2. Running the script launches the GUI for the character portrait generator
  - random will make a random portrait
  - saving will pop up a save dialog to save your generated character portrait
  - The script itself could maybe use some cleanup (I should remove some print statements)
  
3. You should be able to add any .png to the folders and they will work accordingly, I suggest you do this. Alpha channels are respected.

4. This project also serves as a case study for why you should get a decent artist.
